        <text style="font-size:200%;color:#ffffff;">Kondana Caves, nestled cosily in a dense forest near Kondana Village, 33 kilometers (about 20.51 mi) north of Lonavala and about 15 kilometers (about 9.32 mi) from Karjat, Maharashtra. These caves were discovered in the 1st century BC and consist of intricate and delicate carvings of Buddhist architecture. Although an earthquake in 1900 damaged some parts of the caves, the existing structures are worth seeing. One can take a stroll in the caves and experience the regal aura of the stone-cut structure. The beauty of these caves has waterfalls nearby which look beautiful during monsoon.

          <br> <u> Best Time to Visit Kondana Caves </u><br>
            
            September to February is the best time to visit the Kondana caves as the weather is pleasant and dry making it easier for walking to and through the caves. June to September is the best time if you enjoy monsoon treks in the lush greenery around the caves
            
           <br> <u>How To Reach Kondana Caves</u> <br>
            
            Take a bus or rickshaw from Karjat to Kondivade and then continue to Kondane or Kharvandi village, as the caves are equally near from both these places. Auto rides and State Transport buses are easily available from Karjat Station. It takes about 40 min to reach the village at the base of the caves. You can also trek down the western slope of Rajmachi Plateau to reach the caves.

               <text style="font-size:100%;color:#ffffff;">The chaityagriha in the Garbhgiri hills, though badly damaged due to weathering and close Jointing of the rock, possesses an intact central hall with a stupa and betrays an abortive attempt to carve a pradakshina‐ patha, or ambulatory, and pillars around this central hall.  The reason for the incompletion is unknown.   When excavation of rock ceased, three pillars on the left side had been hewn, with the first two carved with the characteristic octagonal shape in cross‐section typical of early Buddhist architecture.Therefore, the intended morphology of the cave is the so‐called “chaitya hall” that in its complete form includes a vaulted ceiling, pillared support, and path for circumambulation.  With a depth of 36 feet, the chaitya hall carved into the Garbhgiri hills was created on a relatively modest scale. A figure of local Goddess Satwai about 10 feet high in low relief made in cement, has been installed by the local people above the stupa at the apsidal end. About 100 meters on the Western side of the chaityagriha is an unfinished Vihara. These Buddhist caves certainly play a vital role in building the chronology of rock‐cut caves of Western India.

                <text style="font-size:100%;color:#ffffff;">Info<br>
                  Pandavleni, also known as Tirthankar Leni, Panch Pandav or Pandav Leni Jain cave, is ancient rock-cut sculptures complex located at Gomai River around 6 kilometer north of Shahada, Maharashtra. These caves were excavated by Jain saints 2,000 years ago. 
                  <br>How to reach<br>
                  The Pandavleni complex is in the bed of Gomai river carved in one solid rock. The Pandavleni is around 10 metres below the rest of terrain. There are rather identical two structures around 15 metres apart in east-west line. Sculptures in rock are carved in such a way that water in river flows over the rock, water falls in sculpture complex but force of water do not impact sculptures. It is like sculpture carved on the wall of well. During flood well will be filled with water and water will flow over well without causing any damage to sculpture on the wall of the well.
