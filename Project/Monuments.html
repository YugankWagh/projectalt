                 The majestic Shaniwarwada, spread over 625 acres (about the area of Central Park in New York City), was the seat of Maratha Peshwa and is a remarkable sight. The seven-storied mansion was built by Peshwa Bajirao I and could house as many as 1000 people. The fortification of Shaniwarwada comprises five gateways and nine bastions that enclosed the whole complex and a door that dissuaded enemy attacks. The place was destroyed by mysterious fires in 1827 which continued to rise. It eventually led to the destruction of the entire palace complex except for the mirror hall and the outer wall. The principal gate of Shaniwarwada was Dilli Darwaja Delhi Gate the other gates were Mastani or Alibahadur Darwaja, Khidki Darwaja, Ganesh Darwaja and Narayan Darwaja.

                Soneri Mahal was built by a Bandalkand chief who accompanied Aurangzeb into the Dakhan. The Mahal was built between 1651 AD and 1653 AD at a cost of Rs.50, 000 and in 1934 AD it was sold to the Nizam of Hyderabad for Rs.26, 400. The Mahal is named after the paintings in the palace that were once painted in gold. 
                It is a grand two stored building constructed in typical Rajput style. The palace is made up of lime and stone. Sprawling over two storeys, the palace stands as a testimony of Indian architectural splendor with some intricate decorations all over. A well-manicured garden adds to its beauty. The entrance of the Palace is decorated with beautifully done arches.
