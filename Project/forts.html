        <text style="font-size:200%;color:#ffffff;">The fort is located 33 km from Sawantwadi and 26 km from Vengurla. The fort is approached via crumbling gateways leading through the surrounding forest, and past a deep trench that surrounds part of the structure.  

            Once at the main entrance you will pass through several small rooms and corridors, where tree roots cascade over the walls of the fort. These lead to the huge, roofless inner chambers of the citadel that have long since yielded to nature. Animals like langur monkeys, or drongo birds can be seen at the fort. <br>
            The fort can be accessed by two routes – Ratnagiri – Pawas – Adivare – Nate or Rajapur – Nate. S.T. buses are available from Rajapur and Ratnagiri to reach Nate. It takes 15 minutes on foot to reach the fort from the village or one can also opt for an auto till the base. Buses going to Ambolgad can be taken to alight at the fort.

                <image src="img/Suvarnadurg.jpg" Width="369" height="369"></image></center>
                <text style="font-size:200%;color:#ffffff;">The fort was captured by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1660 by defeating Ali Adil Shah II (1656–1672). Kanhoji Angre (1667–1729), popularly known as "Samudratla Shivaji" (Shivaji of the sea) was the Admiral of the Maratha Navy; in 1696, Kanhoji's naval fleet was stationed here. However, the fort was formally handed over to Kanhoji in 1713 by Shahu Raja. 

                    At the main entry, carvings of a Hanuman carved on the wall and a carved turtle on one of the leading steps are seen. The sea-gate depicts carved figures of a tiger, eagle and elephants. The fort is fortified with many bastions, which also have small built-in rooms. The central part of the fort has two granaries and a decrepit building. From the Chor Darwaja, steps lead to the fort. Locations of old palaces in the fort area are inferred from the large number of foundation plinths seen in the fort area. A stone building in the fort precincts has been identified as an ammunition magazine. Fifteen old guns have also been located in the fort 
                    
                    To reach the fort, one has to take a boat ride from Harne village. You can reach the Suvarnadurg fort only by boats from Harne. Currently, there is no regular boat service to the fort but boats are available through the local fishermen. Every day, many tourists visit this fort by boats.

                <text style="font-size:200%;color:#ffffff;">Unlike the inner structure, majority of its wall is still intact. At a moderate pace, it takes two hours to walk along the winding Visapoor walls. 

                    The cheapest and convenient way to reach the fort is via railways. The nearest railhead to Visapur Fort is Malavli station (approx. 5 km) which is well connected to Mumbai, Lonavala, and Pune via local trains. From Malavli station shared auto/taxi are available for the base village of Visapur Fort 
                    
                    It was built during 1713-1720 CE by Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa of Maratha Empire. Visapur fort was built much later than Lohagad but the histories of the two forts are closely linked. 
                    
                    In 1818, when reducing the Peshwa's forts, the strength of Lohagad and its fame as the treasury of the Maratha kingdom, caused the English to make special preparations for its attack. A detachment of 380 European and 800 native soldiers, with a battering train, summoned from Konkan, were joined by artillery from Chakan, and two other British battalions. On 4 March 1818, Visapur was attacked and occupied. </text><br>

                   <br> <text style="font-size:200%;color:#ffffff;">Malhargad is a hill fort in western India near Saswad, 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Pune. It is also known as Sonori Fort due to the village of Sonori being situated at its base. The fort was named for the god Malhari and was the last fort built by the Marathas, in 1775. 

                    The fort was built by Bhivrâo Yashvant and Krishnaji Mâdhavrâo Pânsê, a Peshwa Sardar 
                    
                    From Pune, one has to head towards Saswad via Hadapsar route. There are 2 ways to get to the fort, 1st way goes to the Mahadarwaja and the second leads to the back of the fort. 
                    
                    The fort is maintained pretty well by the locals and the grampanchayat. You will get some amazing views of the nearby valleys and the villages from the fort. If you are lucky, you might also get to see Deers, Wild Boars and Porcupines near the base of the fort.  </text>

                   <br> <text style="font-size:200%;color:#ffffff;">Altitude: 4250ft 
                    Type: Hill Fort 
                    Timings: Open 24 Hours
                    District: Ahmednagar
                    The fort is 400 years old. Ratangad was captured by Chhatapati Shivaji Raje Bhosle. 
                    The fort is named after Ratnabai Tandal, who has a small temple inside the cave on the fort. 
                    She was one of the three sisters : Ratnabai, Kalsubai and Katrabai. 
                    There are two main routes to reach the fort. One route starts from village Samrad and the other from village Ratanwadi. The base village Ratanwadi is approached by boat from Bhandardara or by road from Ghoti-Bhandardara road. By boat, it is a 6 km journey and further it is a 4 km walk till Ratanwadi. The trek route from Ratanwadi is the simplest one, it passes through dense forest along the northern bank of the Pravasa river till it reaches a scarp. The final climb is made easy by the iron ladders constructed by the forest department. The local villagers on weekends, erect small shacks on the way to provide tea and snacks for the trekkers.  </text>
